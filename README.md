# UNED's glossary to Anki deck

Being a student at the UNED, I have found that many subjects offer a glossary of "important" terms for the subject. This notebook shows a way to automate the export file of such glossary to Anki eliminating part of the, in my opinion, horrible format in which the UNED allows you to download it.

In the example it's used to parse the terms and definitions from the GEI subject.

Unfortunately much of the code consists of cleaning up the original formatting but, even so, I hope this workbook can be of help to you in similar tasks.
